IPV4:
IPv4 uses a 32-bit address format, allowing for up to 4.3 billion unique addresses. However, due to the explosive growth of the internet, 
this number of addresses has been exhausted and is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of today's devices.
IPV6:
IPv6, on the other hand, uses a 128-bit address format, which provides an almost infinite number of unique addresses, making it more than 
capable of meeting the demands of the growing number of devices connected to the internet.
PROTOCOL:
A protocol is like a set of rules that devices on a network follow when communicating with each other. Just like how people follow rules and 
etiquette when communicating with each other, devices on a network follow protocols to make sure that they can understand each other and exchange 
information effectively.
NETWORK:
A network is a collection of devices that are connected to each other to exchange information and share resources. These devices can include computers
servers, printers, routers, switches, and other types of hardware and software.
INTERNET PROTOCOL:
Internet Protocol (IP) is a fundamental protocol used in computer networking to facilitate communication between devices over the internet. 
IP is responsible for routing data packets between different networks and ensuring that they are delivered to their intended destination.
LAN:LOCAL AREA NETWORK
A LAN, or Local Area Network, is a network that connects devices in a small geographic area, such as a home, office, or school. LANs are typically 
used to allow devices to share resources, such as files, printers, and internet access. LANs are usually connected using Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi, 
and they typically have high speeds and low latency.
WAN: WIDE AREA NETWORK
WAN, or Wide Area Network, is a network that covers a larger geographic area, such as a city, country, or even the entire world. WANs are typically 
used to connect LANs together, allowing devices in different locations to communicate with each other.
TCP: TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL
TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable transmission of data by establishing a dedicated 
connection between two devices before transmitting data. TCP uses a series of mechanisms, such as error checking, flow control, and retransmission 
of lost packets, to ensure that data is delivered reliably and in order. TCP is commonly used for applications that require high reliability, such as 
web browsing, email, and file transfer.
UDP: USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL
UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a dedicated connection between two devices before transmitting 
data. UDP simply sends data packets to their destination without checking whether they have been received or not. UDP is faster and more efficient 
than TCP, but it is less reliable and does not guarantee that data will be delivered correctly. UDP is commonly used for applications that require 
speed and efficiency, such as online gaming, video streaming, and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) services.
ICMP: INTERNET CONTROL MESSAGE PROTOCOL
ICMP, or Internet Control Message Protocol, is a network protocol that is used for diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes. ICMP messages are 
typically generated by routers or other network devices to inform other devices of network conditions or errors. ICMP is used to report errors such
as unreachable hosts, network congestion, and routing issues. ICMP is also used by network administrators to test network connectivity and diagnose
network problems.
IGMP:INTERNET GROUP MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL
IGMP, or Internet Group Management Protocol, is a protocol used to manage multicast group membership. Multicast is a networking technology that 
allows a single data stream to be sent to multiple recipients simultaneously.
ROUTING:
Routing is the process of selecting the best path for network traffic to travel from one device to another on a computer network.
SUBNET:
Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks, each of which can be independently managed and connected to other
subnetworks as needed. Subnetting is typically used to improve network performance, security, and scalability.
INBOUND RULES:
Inbound rules can be used to protect the network from malicious traffic and to allow authorized traffic to enter the network.
OUTBOUND RULES:
Outbound rules can be used to prevent unauthorized data from leaving the network, and to ensure that network resources are used efficiently.
SSH:
SSH, or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol that is used to securely connect to a remote server or device over an unsecured network.
LOAD BALANCING:
Load balancing is a technique that helps distribute network traffic across multiple servers or network resources to improve performance 
and reliability.
HTTP: 
HTTP is a protocol used to transmit data over the internet. It is an application layer protocol and is used for transferring hypertext 
(text with links) between web browsers and servers.
HTTPS:
HTTPS, on the other hand, is a secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to provide a secure channel between the web browser and the server
. This encryption ensures that the data being transmitted between the client and server cannot be intercepted, read, or modified by third parties. 
HTTPS is commonly used for transactions that involve sensitive information, such as online banking, e-commerce transactions, and secure logins.
SSL: Secure Socket Layer
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol used to secure communication over the internet. SSL is the predecessor to the newer TLS (Transport Layer 
Security) protocol. The main uses of SSL include:
1.Encryption: SSL uses encryption to secure the data being transmitted between the client and server. This encryption ensures that any data 
transmitted over the internet cannot be read or modified by unauthorized parties.
2.Authentication: SSL provides authentication to verify the identity of the server and the client. This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, 
where an attacker intercepts the communication between the client and server and impersonates one of them.
3.Integrity: SSL provides data integrity, which ensures that the data being transmitted between the client and server has not been tampered with or 
modified in transit.
VIRUS:
A virus in a network is a malicious program that can spread from one computer to another over a network connection. A network virus can infect a 
computer system by exploiting security vulnerabilities in the operating system or other software running on the system.
1.Worms: A worm is a type of virus that can spread rapidly over a network, exploiting security vulnerabilities in the operating system and software 
to infect other computers.
2.Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a malicious program that disguises itself as a legitimate program but actually contains harmful code that can 
damage the network or steal data.
3.Botnets: A botnet is a network of infected computers that can be controlled remotely by a hacker to perform malicious activities such as DDoS 
attacks or stealing sensitive data.
SMTP:Simple mail transfer protocol
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for sending and receiving email messages over the internet. SMTP is a text-based protocol 
and operates on the application layer of the OSI model.
FIREWALL:
A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls can be 
implemented in hardware or software, and are designed to protect a network from unauthorized access and malicious traffic.
